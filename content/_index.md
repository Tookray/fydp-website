Welcome to our FYDP website. This is a place where we document our progress.

## About

There is currently no industry solution for repeatedly launching a frisbee/disk,
so testing discs is unreliable and ratings are vague.

We are a team of 5 students from the University of Waterloo looking to build a
device that can recreate launch conditions with high precision and
repeatability.
