## Disk Gripper Prototype

A prototype disc gripping design was created. It was a failure as it did not constrain the disc enough and it kept falling to the side. There was a lot of play as well, with the tall arm bending, so the vertical style mount will not be used in future versions.

## MCU Requirements

The Main Control Unit (MCU) is used to implement the main software functionality of the project. It will have the role of managing the user interface, interacting with the motor controllers, and actuating the gripper release. To understand the requirements of the MCU, first the different actuators and sensors of the system were defined.

### Sensors

- __Primary shaft motor encoder__: feedback from the primary encoder about the speed and position of the arm motor.
- __Secondary gripper motor encoder__: feedback from the secondary encoder about the rotational speed of the disc motor.
- __Angle motor encoder__: feedback from the servo/stepper motor used to control the tilt angle of the launcher.
- __User interface buttons__: this includes a start button, safe stop button, a number pad to input speeds and other numbers, and several other selection buttons.
- __Guard interlock switches__: these switches are used to ensure that guards around moving parts such as the gearboxes or rotating arms are closed. They will also be wired to the motor power supply similarly to an e-stop.
- __E-stops__: used to shut off power to the motors, or the whole system.

### Actuators/Outputs

- __Main shaft motor__: this motor will control the speed of the arm.
- __Secondary gripper motor__: this motor will control the rotational speed of the disc.
- __Angle motor__: this motor will control the tilt angle of the launcher.
- __Gripper release__: used to release the disc from the gripper so it can be launched.
- __LCD screen__: used to send messages to the user.

Once the inputs and outputs for the system are defined, the signals to and from the MCU can be designed.

### Input signals

- __User interface buttons__: digital signals that correspond to a button being pressed.
- __Programming interface__: used to connect directly to the MCU during testing and debugging.
- __Motor speeds and positions__: digital pulse signals from the motor controllers.
- __Guard interlock switches__: digital signal corresponding to a door being open.
- __E-stops__: digital signals corresponding to a button being pressed.

### Output signals

- __Motor speed__: Analog signal sent to the motor controllers
- __Gripper release__: PWM digital signal sent to the gripper release
- __User LCD screen__: data, control, and address signals
- __Status LEDs__: digital signal

The MCU should also have a way to receive and transmit bluetooth signals. This is due to the possibility of using an app to control the machine in future developments.
