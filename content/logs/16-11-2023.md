## Shaft Design nad Gripper Prototype

First draft of the main arm system and shaft completed. Materials picked (Aluminum 6061) and hand calculations done on the shaft and bearings.With an "open ended" design, where the shaft is constraint only on one side of the arm, it required quite a large shaft, with a diameter of 40mm at the critical points.

Second prototype of disc gripper created, this time on a horizontal base plate, with smaller rollers, and more points of contact. This version was much more successful and gave us hope for this style of holder (as opposed to a suction cup based disc holder).

## MCU Selection

By looking at the required input and output signals to the MCU, the required amount of GPIO pins can be determined. A total of 20 pins for input, and 24 for output are needed.

To fulfil the bluetooth requirement, the MCU could either use a bluetooth module, or have the microcontroller have an internal receiver and transmitter. To reduce the need to redesign the MCU in the future and for simplicity, it was decided to use an internal bluetooth module.

The next decision was the family of microcontrollers to use. Based on our previous familiarity with different microcontrollers, both the STM32 and AVR families were considered. Due to the more extensive STM32 documentation and support, as well as being inexpensive, a STM32 microcontroller was chosen.

The microcontroller chosen was the STM32WB55RGV6, which has an internal wireless bluetooth module. It also has a total of 64 pins, of which 49 are GPIO. We chose the model that has 1 MB of flash memory. Although the program will not likely use the full memory, the price difference is minimal. During future iterations scaling down may be possible once the total size of the program is determined.

The chosen microcontroller is surface mount. This means that for prototyping purposes it cannot be directly used on a breadboard or perfboard, which are faster and more inexpensive to make changes. The options under consideration for MCU construction are to design and order a full PCB directly, or to first design a simple breadboard interface to allow the individual pins to be accessed more easily.
