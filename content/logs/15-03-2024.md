As part of our system testing, it was found that the overall launcher
experiences siginificant vibrations when the main arm spins at 300 rpm. Hence
several mechanical changes were made including adding brackets on all corners
to hold the sides together. Braces were also added on the front and side for
further protection of the users.

A front plate was also waterjet and added for increasing the stability as well
as preventing shearing of the two plywood plates. The CAD design is as shown
below.

Based on our advisors, Prof. Kennings and Prof. Khamesee, the pulley on the top
was also covered for additional safety.

Counterweight analysis was also conducted in SolidWorks to determine if the arm
is well balanced and their center of masses are aligned.
