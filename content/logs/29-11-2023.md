## Gripper Prototype 3

The last disc gripper prototype was modified with some PCV bushings on the side, it turned out that with the top bearing this was enough to constrain the discs motion. Friction was greatly reduced and the side holders are now greatly simplified.

## Case Design

Shaft design changed with bearing on both sides, so that the shaft can be stiffer and use less material. Upon further discussion with the stakeholder, the tilting mechanism is put on the backburner so we can focus on the critical components and safety first and foremost. The design is now encased with plywood and Lexan sheets. Lexan is chosen to surround the disc because of the materials excellent impact resistance, it is unlikely to shatter and should protect us from any erroneous disc releases.
