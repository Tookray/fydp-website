Based on tight timelines and constrained team schedules, the following time line was set up based on the teamâ€™s availability and prioritisation of tasks. Currently part procurement is to be completed prior to 10th of December to allow lead time for parts.

Several aspects of the project involve simultaneous development, namely mechanical, electrical and firmware. This is necessary to allow for sufficient time for system integration and testing/tuning. The majority of the 4B term will be dedicated towards testing and integration of components.
