Once all components were machined, they were added onto the launcher such as
the front plate as well as side braces. The launcher was then clamped onto a
table and tested with a net at the main arm spinning at 350 rpm. In this test,
the solenoid trigger was activated with the help of a hall effect sensor
detecting the arm and automatically launching the disc once the set speed was
reached.
