We then tested the disc spin plus arm rotation to determine the system
stability. The disc was spun upto 300 rpm via bluetooth while the arm was
tested at 100 rpm with the solenoid activated manually. The arm was then
increased to 200 rpm to test the launch. Initial tests were conducted against a
wall and then unobstructed since it was at low speeds.
