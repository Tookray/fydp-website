Solenid was mounted onto the frame and tested. This activates the release latch

Once solenoid was mounted, the external enclosures on three sides were fixated.
This includes steel plates on two sides and clear lexan on the back for the
user to view the disc being spun.

Following the sides being put on, the launcher was put on its legs. Due to some
supplier issues, one of the legs was defective and could not be put on.
