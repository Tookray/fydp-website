Primary Motor, Motor Controller and Battery options investigated.
Current option involves a 48 V Brushless DC motor rated at 4000 rpm speed with 0.73 Nm Torque that can be geared to produce desired mechanical speeds and torque for spinning the gripper arm.
Hence, battery will also be 48 V as well, and rated to be over 30 Ah at least to provide enough power for multiple tests in a day with the robot.
